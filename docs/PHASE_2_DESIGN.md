# 🏗️ MediSync Phase 2 — Technical Design Document

This document outlines the architectural decisions, logic flows, and database designs for **Phase 2 (Clinical Operations)**.

---

## 1. Appointment Scheduling Engine (Phase 2.1)

The goal is to move from a static availability model to a dynamic, relational system that supports complex scheduling needs.

### 🗓️ Logic Flow: Slot Generation
To generate available slots for a doctor on a specific date, the `SlotGeneratorService` follows these steps:

1.  **Identify Base Windows**: Fetch all active `DoctorAvailability` rows for that `DayOfWeek`.
2.  **Filter by Exceptions**: Check the `DoctorDayOff` table for that specific date. If it's a day off, return zero slots.
3.  **Calculate Working Blocks**: For each availability window (e.g., 09:00 - 12:00 and 14:00 - 17:00):
    *   Subdivide into raw slots based on `slotDuration`.
4.  **Subtract Breaks**: Remove any slots that overlap with time ranges in the `DoctorBreak` table.
5.  **Subtract Booked Appointments**: Fetch all `CONFIRMED` or `PENDING` appointments for that date and remove overlapping slots.
6.  **Concurrency Protection**: Use **Redis Distributed Locks** during the actual booking process to prevent two patients from grabbing the same slot simultaneously.

### 🗄️ Database Changes
*   **DoctorAvailability**: Normalized from columns (mondayStartTime, etc.) to a separate table.
*   **DoctorBreak**: New table linked to availability to allow unlimited breaks per day.
*   **DoctorDayOff**: New table for one-off exceptions (vacations, emergencies).

## 2. Advanced Prescription System (Phase 2.2)

Moving beyond simple JSON storage to a relational, template-based system with safety checks.

### 💊 Logic Flow: Prescription Creation
1.  **Template Selection (Optional)**: Doctor can pull a `PrescriptionTemplate` to pre-fill medications.
2.  **Interaction Check**: Before saving, the system calls the `DrugInteractionService` (integrating with OpenFDA) to check for dangerous combinations.
3.  **Relational Storage**: Medications are stored in a dedicated `PrescriptionMedication` table for better querying and reporting.
4.  **PDF Generation**: A background job uses `pdfkit` to generate a professional, watermarked PDF for the patient.

---

## 3. Medical Records V2 (Phase 2.3)

Ensuring data integrity and security through versioning, encryption, and audit logs.

### 🛡️ Security & Versioning Flow
*   **Versioning**: When a file is updated, the original record remains unchanged. A new `MedicalRecordVersion` is created, allowing users to view the history of changes.
*   **AES-256 Encryption**:
    1.  File is uploaded.
    2.  `EncryptionService` encrypts the file at rest using a key managed via an external KMS.
    3.  Only authorized users (patient or doctors with a `RecordShare` entry) can trigger decryption.
*   **Audit Logging**: Every "View", "Download", or "Share" action is recorded in `FileAuditLog` with IP and Timestamp.

---

## 4. Clinic & Doctor Profile System (Phase 2.4)

Enabling multi-tenant clinic support and public-facing profiles.

### 🏥 Clinic Management
*   **Verification Workflow**: Clinics are created in a `PENDING` state. An Admin must review license documents before the clinic is marked `isVerified`.
*   **Insurance Normalization**: A global `InsuranceProvider` table allows doctors to select which plans they accept, which is then searchable by patients.
*   **Reviews**: Patients can only review a doctor *after* a completed appointment to ensure authenticity.

## 📁 Proposed Phase 2 Directory Structure

To maintain a clean separation of concerns, the following structure is proposed for the Phase 2 modules:

```bash
src/
├── appointments/
│   ├── controllers/         # Appointment & Availability endpoints
│   ├── services/            # SlotGenerator, AvailabilityService
│   ├── dto/                 # Request/Response validation
│   └── appointments.module.ts
├── prescriptions/
│   ├── services/            # PrescriptionService, DrugInteraction, PDFGenerator
│   ├── dto/                 # Templates & Medication DTOs
│   └── prescriptions.module.ts
├── medical-records/
│   ├── services/            # EncryptionService, AuditService, Compression
│   ├── dto/                 # Versioning & Sharing DTOs
│   └── medical-records.module.ts
└── clinics/
    ├── services/            # ClinicService, Verification, Insurance
    ├── dto/                 # Clinic & Review DTOs
    └── clinics.module.ts
