## 🏥 MediSync API

**MediSync** is a professional **Medical follow-up & Records Management System** built with **NestJS**, designed to streamline healthcare processes between doctors and patients.

### ❓ Problem Statement

Healthcare in many regions, including Egypt, still relies heavily on fragmented paper records, leading to lost medical histories, prescription errors, and inefficient doctor-patient communication. MediSync exists to bridge this gap by providing a secure, centralized digital platform for reliable healthcare management.

## 🛠️ What We Are Doing (Current Features)

The current version of MediSync API provides a robust foundation for digital healthcare:

- 👤 **Multi-role Authentication** — Specialized workflows for Patients, Doctors, and Admins.
- 🔐 **Advanced Security** — Secure email verification with OTP, password reset flow, and Google OAuth2 integration.
- 📱 **Device-based Sessions** — Refresh tokens are bound to specific devices; users can view active device sessions and revoke them (e.g., `GET /auth/sessions`, `DELETE /auth/sessions/:id`).
- 💊 **Digital Prescriptions** — Doctors can create, manage, and share prescriptions securely.
- 🔗 **Connection System** — Seamless connection requests between doctors and patients via invitations or **QR Code Scanning**.
- 💬 **Real-time Communication** — Integrated Chat System using WebSockets for direct messaging between doctors and patients.
- 🧾 **QR Verification** — Secure QR code generation for clinic check-ins and prescription validation.
- 📂 **Medical Records** — Secure file management for medical reports, lab results, and X-rays.
- 🔔 **Instant Notifications** — Real-time in-app and email notifications for appointments, requests, and messages.
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized** — Layered caching with Redis and database connection pooling.

## 🎯 Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP) ✅

- [x] Multi-role Auth & Email Verification
- [x] Google OAuth Integration
- [x] Device-based session management
- [x] Connection requests (Doctor-Patient)
- [x] Digital Prescriptions & QR Verification
- [x] Real-time Chat & Notifications
- [x] File management for medical records

### Phase 2: Clinical Operations 🚀

_Turning the app from a "chat tool" into a professional clinic management system._

#### 2.1 — Appointment Scheduling Engine

- Doctors define availability slots (days, hours, duration per session).
- Patient booking with **Redis Locks** to prevent double-booking.
- State management: `PENDING` → `CONFIRMED` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `COMPLETED` → `CANCELLED`.
- Auto-reminders via **@nestjs/schedule** (24h/1h before).
- Calendar export (.ics) for Google/Apple Calendar.

#### 2.2 — Advanced Prescription System

- Prescription templates for reusable medication combos.
- **Drug Interaction Checker** (Integration with OpenFDA or similar API).
- Expiry tracking and patient renewal requests.

- File versioning and auto-categorization (LAB_RESULT, XRAY, etc.).
- **End-to-End Encryption (AES-256)** for files at rest.
- Automatic image compression using **sharp**.
- **File Access Audit Logs** (HIPAA-style tracking).
- Scoped record sharing (Patient shares specific files with specific doctors).

#### 2.4 — Clinic & Doctor Profile System

- Multi-clinic management (different fees/schedules per clinic).
- Admin-led Clinic verification (license uploads).
- Patient reviews/ratings with abuse detection.
- Specialization tags and education history.
